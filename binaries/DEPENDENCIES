Besides the tarball, you need a few external deps.


For your distribution:

First, install libc6:i386 for 64-bit systems.

Debian: sudo apt-get install $(./convmlv.sh -K 0)
Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install $(./convmlv.sh -K 1)
Fedora: sudo yum install $(./convmlv.sh -K 2)
Mac (Homebrew): brew install $(./convmlv.sh -K 3)


For Python (make sure you're using Python 3.X):

sudo python3 -m pip install $(./convmlv -Y)
