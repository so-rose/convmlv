	  --> JPG proxy will always be in sRGB Gamma/sRGB Gamut. H.264 proxy is color managed.
	  --> JPG proxy *won't* be developed w/o IMAGE. H.264 proxy *will* be developed no matter what, if specified here.

	  --> Spacial/Temporal (S/T). S will soften/blur/smooth, T will remove noise without doing that but may create artifacts.
	  --> Luma/Chroma (L/C). L is the detail, C is the color. Each one's denoising may be manipulated Spacially or Temporally.
	  
	  --> Option Value: <LS>-<CS>:<LT>-<CT>

	  --> Size/Strength (S/T). S is the size of the sharpen/blur effect, T is the strength of the sharpen/blur effect.
	  --> Luma/Chroma (L/C). L is the detail, C is the color. Luma sharpening more effective.
	
	  --> Option Value: <LS>:<LT>:<CS>:<CT>

COLOR MANAGEMENT:
	INTRO Images aren't simple. They are often stored, processed, and viewed as a result of complex transformations usually called, 
	in applications, color management. Understanding it is required as a colourist, and encouraged as a DPs and Cinematographers.
	
	--> Intro: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-management1.htm
	--> Understanding Gamma: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/gamma-correction.htm
	--> Color Spaces: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-spaces.htm
	--> Conversions: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/color-space-conversion.htm
	--> Monitor Calibration: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/monitor-calibration.htm
	
	PIPELINE convmlv is a color managed application, designed to retain quality from RAW footage:
	
		-- mlv_dump writes camera-specific color transformation matrices as metadata in developed DNGs.
			--> This defines the camera's gamut.
		-- dcraw applies these matrices, then transforms the newly developed image to the super-wide XYZ colorspace.
			--> All color detail is preserved, and if now in a well-defined colorspace.
			--> No gamma has been applied - the image is now Linear XYZ.
		-- ffmpeg applies the specified (up to) x64 resolution 3D LUTs, in .cube format.
			--> Use -g and -G to specify Gamma/Gamut combinations.
			--> The output employs DATA, not LEGAL, values. The resulting image is flatter, but retains all shadow/highlight detail.
			--> -l specified LUTs are applied afterwards.
	
	3D LUTS The included LUTs, found in the convmlv repository, are key to convmlv's color management solution:
		-- color-core: The required LUTs, including sRGB (default), Adobe RGB, and Rec709 in Standard and Linear gamma.
		-- color-ext: Optional LUTs, including Rec2020, DCI-P3, etc. in Standard/Linear gammas, but also in Log formats.
		
	Create Your Own LUTs using LUTCalc, for any grading format output: https://cameramanben.github.io/LUTCalc/ (watch his tutorials).
	 --> Note that convmlv only accepts up to 64x64x64 LUTs. You can resize LUTs using pylut (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylut).
	 --> The pylut command to resize is 'pylut <yourx65lut>.cube --resize 64'. Alternatively, you can use pylut from Python (2X only).
	 
	 --> I reccommend Legal --> Data LUTs, as this conserves shadow/highlight detail for grading. Legal --> Legal looks better, but with detail loss.
	
	
CONFIG FILE:
	Config files, another way to specify options, can save you time & lend you convenience in production situations.
	
	GLOBAL: /home/sofus/convmlv.conf
	LOCAL: Specify -C/--config.
	
	
	SYNTAX:
		Most options listed above have an uppercased VARNAME, ex. OUTDIR. You can specify such options in config files, as such:
		
			<VARNAME> <VALUE>
			
		One option per line only. Indentation by tabs or spaces is allowed, but not enforced.
			
		Comments Lines starting with # are comments.
		
		You may name a config using:
		
			CONFIG_NAME <name>
			
		Flags If the value is a true/false flag (ex. IMAGE), simply specifying VARNAME is enough. There is no VALUE.
	
	OPTION ORDER OF PRECEDENCE Options override each other as such:
		-LOCAL options overwrite GLOBAL options.
		-COMMAND LINE options overwrite LOCAL & GLOBAL options.
		-FILE SPECIFIC options overwrite ALL ABOVE options.
	
	
	File-Specific Block: A LOCAL config file lets you specify options for specific input names:
	
		/ <TRUNCATED INPUTNAME>
			...options here will only be 
		*
		
		You must use the truncated (no .mlv or .raw) input name after the /. Nested blocks will fail.
		
		With a single config file, you can control the development options of multiple inputs as specifically and/or generically
		as you want. Batch developing everything can then be done with a single, powerful commmand.
